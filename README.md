## 🧠 Final Year Project: Intelligent Accident Damage Assessment

I developed a machine learning model that:

- 📷 Analyzes vehicle images to detect **types and severity of damage**
- 🔧 Uses a pre-trained model to estimate **repair costs**
- 📊 Implemented using **Google Colab** with libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib
- 🤖 Focused on visual data classification, regression, and real-world cost modeling

> 🚀 This project demonstrates my ability to combine ML, image processing, and practical problem-solving in the automotive space.
